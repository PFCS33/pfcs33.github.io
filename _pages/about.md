Hi!👋 Welcome to my personal page, where I share my journey, projects, and aspirations. I'm currently a `Master`'s student in `Visual Computing` at Simon Fraser University, actively seeking `Summer 2026 co-op` opportunities in `software development`/`data science`/`machine leaning`.

I bring `1 year+ full-time` frontend experience, where I led the development of 6+ core modules of company's network planning platform using Vue3 and TypeScript, with 100% completion rate. And My research work has also been published in top-tier venues including `ACM UIST 2025` and `IEEE TVCG 2024`, focusing on visual analytics and data visualization systems. I completed my bachelor degree in Computer Science at Beijing Institute of Technology, with `solid CS background` knowledge.

My technical foundation spans across:

- Frontend: Vue.js, D3.js, TypeScript, JavaScript

- Backend: Python, Java, Node.js, RESTful APIs

- Core CS: C/C++, compiler design, operating systems

I'm looking for `frontend`, `backend`, `full-stack`, or `ML engineering` roles` where I can contribute to impactful products. I work well in collaborative environments and enjoy solving challenging problems that create meaningful user experiences.
Feel free to reach out—I'd love to connect and discuss opportunities!
