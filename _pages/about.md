I finished my **bachelor's degree in Computer Science** from [Beijing Institute of Technology](https://english.bit.edu.cn/). During my undergrad, I worked as a research assistant with [Prof. Guozheng Li](https://guozhengli2021.github.io/homepage/), developing interactive **data analytics and visualization tools**. After graduation, I worked for a year as a **frontend developer** building web applications. Now I am pursuing a **Master of Visual Computing** at [Simon Fraser University](https://www.sfu.ca/), diving deeper into **machine learning** and **computer vision** techniques.

Beyond work, I'm a big video game fan — CRPGs:game_die: are my favorite genre. I'm also currently learning to ski! :skier:
