# Personal Academic Website

This is the source code for Yunshan Feng's personal academic website, hosted at [pfcs33.github.io](https://pfcs33.github.io).

## How it works

This website is built with Jekyll using the [al-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio) theme. 
The site automatically deploys to GitHub Pages whenever changes are pushed to the master branch. GitHub's CI/CD pipeline builds the Jekyll site and publishes it to the web.
